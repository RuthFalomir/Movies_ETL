# Movies_ETL
We performed the ETL (Exctract, Tranform, Load) process on a large dataset regarding movies that we obtained from MovieLens and Wikipedia. After we extracted the data we needed, we transformed it by cleaning it and choosing the best source for the columns we kept. Once we had our clean and ready to use dataset, we imported it to pgAdmin for further analysis.
